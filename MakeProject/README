A cmake file that builds and links two files.

Used files:

CMakeLists.txt - the actual cmake file
include - fun.h
source - fun.cpp, main.cpp

Usage:

1) run "cmake -S <path1> -B <path2>" command
	path1 is the direction where are the actual files, it can be just "."
	path2 is the direction where are the make file and other files that cmake made
2) run "cd build" command
3) run "make" command
	a file named "hello" is made in our directory, which is our binary file, that should be run directly
4) run "./hello" command
	"Hello!" text is printed in our shell.

So, the files were build and linked.
